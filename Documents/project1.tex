\section{The maps}

The map files are available at \url{https://github.com/Joshua-Westbrook/AIproject1maps}

They are also in the folder that opens after unzipping the .zip file attached and importing it into Eclipse as an existing project.

\section{The algorithm}

The algorimths can be found in in the searches package. The UCS algorithm is fully implemented in SearchAlgo.java but uses UCS.java so it has a specific name. A* and Weighted A* overwrite the h(n) being zero in UCS with them using either the heuristic from DistanceHeuristic.java or the heuristic times the weight. Unforunately the algorithms do not seem to be working fully properly. There is no error where Weighted A* sometimes returning a cheaper path than A*. We have not been able to figure out the cause yet.

\section{Optimizations}
No optimizations have been done beyond that of following the UCS/A*/Weighted A* rules.

\section{Heuristics}
The Heuristic we finally used was a modified Euclidean distance . We then multiply the Euclidean distance between the currNode and goal by .25 and the start node and the goal by 0.25 since in a best case scenario the entire path to the goal is an highway/river with no hard to travel in which case all movements is the distance divided by 4 which is the same thing as times 0.25
The formula for the heuristic is $\frac{0.25 * \sqrt{(currNode.x - end.x)^2 + (currNode.y - end.y)^2}}{0.25 * \sqrt{(start.x - end.x)^2 + (start.y - end.y)^2}}$.

Other attempted heuristics included just the Euclidean distance which was not admissable. We also tried using numbers like 0.50 or 0.75 instead of 0.25 when modifying the Euclidean  Distance but those failed. Our first attempt was to use just the Euclidean distance from the currNode to the goal which also failed to be admissable.

\section{benchmarks}
The Nodes found by each search is above the cost of the path it found.

\section{Final Explanation}
Unfortuantely as can been seen in some of the benchmarks such as Map1b our heuristic is still not optimal and will sometimes result in A* looking at more nodes than Uniform Cost Search which should not happen. We were unable to find one that was more effective.

Map 2e also shows an issue since it has A* finding a better path than UCS. Again we were unable to figure out what was causing that issue or how we could fix it.

another problm that can be seen on maps like 2j when the start and the goal are close to each other in either the rows or the columns is that A* and Weighted A* end up taking a very windy path while UCS goes straight ahead.
 
 2j also has a problem where even UCS decides to leave the nice path up the highway for no reason we could find. 

Whether these issues are caused by the heuristic not being correct even if it seems to be admissable or if they are caused by something wrong with our search Algorithm is not something we have been able to figure out.
